# SCClustering
Soft Computing Assignments

This repository shows two methods of clustering, which is a class unsupervised machine learning algorithms.
Two methods are K-Means clustering and Fuzzy C-Means clustering.
The dataset is SPECTF with 110 datapoints.

The clustering algorithms have been implemented in Python and use 
libraries like numpy and pandas.
