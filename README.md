Soft Computing Assignments

This repository shows two methods of clustering, which is a class unsupervised machine learning algorithms.
Two methods are K-Means clustering and Fuzzy C-Means clustering.
The dataset is SPECTF with 110 datapoints.

K-means clustering aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean.
Fuzzy C-means clustering is a method of clustering which allows one piece of data to belong to two or more clusters.
